# Image-Forgery-Detection
Detection of copy-move and splice forgeries in images using deep learning and diverse image representation methods

The forgery_detect folder contains the program code
The test_images folder should contain the images to be tested. (Each image as its original and fake copy)
The output_images folder is the directory where the images resulting from forgery detection will be placed
The image_dataset directory contains some sample images to test

To test an image, simply move the image file to the test_images directory

To execute the code:

1. Open a Terminal/Shell
2. Run the command -   python main.py
3. Enter the name of the image file when prompted, say "horse_fake.png" (without quotes) which should be present in a folder containing forged/spliced images.
4. The output images will be generated in the output folder mentioned.
